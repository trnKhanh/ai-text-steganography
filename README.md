# AI Text Steganography
# Description
- This is the baseline implementation of AI Text Steganography for our final project in Software Designing and Applied Information Security courses in HCMUS-VNU.
- Our project focuses on hiding data inside a text sequence generated by LLMs (e.g. GPT-2).
- We took inspiration from [Kirchenbauer et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10226).
